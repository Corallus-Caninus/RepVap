# TODO: Stand for holding a 2-liter type bottle upside down next to Bucket
# TODO: consider a brita filter as a mount since corrosion seems negligable 
#       as long as chlorine bumps off and minerals/metals are filtered. 
#       open loop will corrode a bit anyways but shouldnt change conductive 
#       property of aluminum.
# TODO: this isnt unreasonable given 100% infill with large wall_thickness. 
#       can just insert brita filter in a 3D printed stand. 
#       can use arduino for filter life measurement using the flap button 
#       method of brita
