# RepVap
A *majority* 3D printed evaporative cooler.

This project is currently under active development. I have a working RepVap but you may need assistance.
Email me at ward.joshua92@yahoo.com.

RepVap is a high flow water chiller for direct cooling of aluminum cooling blocks. Its intended use is for 
CPUs and the design is made to be very affordable (~$100 for all the bells and whistles).

RepVap aims to be able to cool VRMs etc. on motherboards. Designed with 
SolidPython an OpenSCAD wrapper. All designs are parametric such that any container could be used. All variations 
of the design can be changed in the respective configuration files for different motherboards or applications.



NOTE: RepVap cannot print itself. the name is simply an omage to the amazing RepRap project and the culture of 
      innovation therein.
