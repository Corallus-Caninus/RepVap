# RepVap
A *majority* 3D printed evaporative cooler.

This project is currently under active development. I have a working RepVap but you may need assistance.

RepVap is a high flow water chiller for cheap aluminum cooling blocks. Its intended use is for 
CPUs and the design is made to be very affordable (~$100 for all the bells and whistles).

RepVap is designed with SolidPython an OpenSCAD wrapper. All designs are parametric such that any container 
could be used (A gable fan on a large trash bin is not out of the question). All variations of the design can be changed in the respective configuration files for different 
motherboards or applications.

I also recommend the following Youtube videos:

      desertsun02's videos on DIY evaporative cooling.

      Major Hardware's video on 3d printed evaporative coolers and PC water cooling loops.

NOTE: RepVap cannot print itself. the name is simply an omage to the amazing RepRap project and the culture of 
      innovation therein.
